This is a story. I suppose it doesn't really matter what goes in the story though.

Its a coding challenge. The things that happen to three little pigs doesn't really hold much bearing on how well I do in this challenge.
Suffice it to say the pigs win, they slay the dragon and rescue the prince and they live happily ever after in some distant land.

Roll Credits.


PSYCH!!!!! Post credits scene.
Despite the pigs efforts, the prince eventually leaves the pigs for no apparent reason because people aren't nice and life isn't a fairy tale!
