This is a story. I suppose it doesn't really matter what goes in the story though.

Its a coding challenge. The things that happen to three little pigs doesn't really hold much bearing on how well I do in this challenge.
Suffice it to say the pigs win, they slay the dragon and rescue the prince and they live happily ever after in some distant land.

Roll Credits.


PSYCH!!!!! Post credits scene.
Despite the pigs efforts, the prince eventually leaves the pigs for no apparent reason because people aren't nice and life isn't a fairy tale!

I could hear him coming.

We huddled in the middle of the room, shivering. Bits of straw still clung to Dill, drifting here and there. The bandage over the bite mark was becoming saturated. I could smell the blood. One drip fell to the floor below, another. But we didn't move.

A scuff of a paw outside. Our eyes darted to the right. Another. He was circling. Looking for a weakness. I hoped that we were ready. That we had prepared. 

Dill was a simple soul. He tended his fields, gathered the acorns stored in the forest, slept in his little house. It had been generations since danger had ever set foot in our region, so he felt secure just sleeping in his little hut. It wasn't much more than a tent, but with thatch rather than canvas. But as he always said, he didn't need more.
