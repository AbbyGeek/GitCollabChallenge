This is a story. I suppose it doesn't really matter what goes in the story though.

Its a coding challenge. The things that happen to three little pigs doesn't really hold much bearing on how well I do in this challenge.
Suffice it to say the pigs win, they slay the dragon and rescue the prince and they live happily ever after in some distant land.

Roll Credits.


PSYCH!!!!! Post credits scene.
Despite the pigs efforts, the prince eventually leaves the pigs for no apparent reason because people aren't nice and life isn't a fairy tale!


There I was sitting in my straw house sipping tea. I look out the window and who do I see but that asshole bully who hasnt left me alone since highschool. Thankfully my house is made of straw so i'm good...i thought to myself. then this dude does something i never thoguht i'd see!


Dude starts huffing and puffing his chest like he's about to blow my house down! I think to myself theres no way. When was the last time you saw a wolf pull a move like that. then this guy does his first blow and me and my house are shook. then he blows again and my house is GONE! my laundry is every where! no respect for my possesions. so i dipped to my boys house. i look behind me and i see him following. I never meant to get my boy involved! i hope he has insurance!
