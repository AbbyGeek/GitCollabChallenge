This is a story. I suppose it doesn't really matter what goes in the story though.

Its a coding challenge. The things that happen to three little pigs doesn't really hold much bearing on how well I do in this challenge.
Suffice it to say the pigs win, they slay the dragon and rescue the prince and they live happily ever after in some distant land.
